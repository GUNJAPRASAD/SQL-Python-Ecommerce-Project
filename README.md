# E-commerce Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of importing raw CSV data into a SQL Server database using Python, followed by data extraction, analysis, and visualization to drive actionable business insights.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python** – For data processing and analysis  
- **Pandas, NumPy** – For data cleaning and manipulation  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – For data visualization  
- **SQL Server** – For structured data storage  
- **PyODBC, SQLAlchemy** – For database connectivity  

## Workflow
1. Imported 7 CSV datasets into SQL Server using Python.
2. Pulled data from SQL for further cleaning and processing.
3. Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) in Python.
4. Generated visual reports on sales, customer behavior, and product performance.

## Key Insights
- **Monthly Sales Trends**: Identified peak and low-performing months.
- **Top Product Categories**: Highlighted categories contributing most to revenue.
- **Customer Behavior**: Tracked order frequency and preferred payment methods.
- **Seller Performance**: Pinpointed top-performing sellers by revenue and order count.

## Recommendations
To improve **sales performance** and **operational efficiency**, the following actions are suggested:
- **Focus on High-Demand Categories**: Allocate more inventory and marketing to top-selling categories.
- **Seller Training & Incentives**: Encourage high-performing sellers and improve support for underperforming ones.
- **Improve Delivery in Low-Rated Areas**: Optimize logistics in areas with lower ratings or higher return rates.
- **Personalized Marketing Campaigns**: Use customer behavior data to create targeted promotions and offers.
- **Analyze Payment Patterns**: Promote popular payment methods and reduce friction for low-used methods.
